"DJI Mavic 2 Pro","The Mavic 2 Pro is a compact, foldable drone that's ideal for travel but features a professional-grade camera, and it’s the first consumer-grade DJI drone to incorporate a Hasselblad camera and its proprietary Hasselblad Natural Color Solution (HNCS) technology. It’s roughly a half-inch larger and weighs slightly more than its predecessor, the Mavic Pro Platinum, but its aerodynamic airframe reduces body drag by up to 19%. The Mavic 2 Pro can fly at speeds of up to 44 mph (70.8 km/h) in Sport mode and remain in the air for up to 31 minutes. It includes 10 sensors located on all sides of the aircraft, enabling it to automatically detect obstacles in its path and help prevent collisions. The improved Advanced Pilot Assistance System (APAS) allows the aircraft to analyze its surrounding environment, and fly around obstacles without stopping. Additional batteries, which are also compatible with the Mavic 2 Zoom, cost $159 each."
"DJI Inspire 2 + Zenmuse X7","The DJI Inspire 2, paired with the Zenmuse X7 camera, is a high-end drone for anyone looking to enter the world of professional cinematography or for photographers who desire the absolute best aerial image quality possible without building their own rig. Its pricing reflects its intended use as a professional tool, while its hefty size and dual-battery requirement mean you’re only likely to take it with you when it’s really needed. The drone can travel at a top speed of 58 mph (93.3 km/h) in Sport Mode, accelerate from 0 - 50 mph in 4 seconds – the type of performance demanded by Hollywood filmmakers. When coupled with the Zenmuse X7 it can remain in the air for 23 minutes. The body is made of professional grade materials, including a durable magnesium alloy shell, and the landing legs retract in flight for full 360° shooting. Extra batteries cost $189 each."
"DJI Mavic 2 Zoom","The Mavic 2 Zoom is essentially an updated and sturdier build of the Mavic Pro with the addition of a 4x zoom lens. This model is ideal for consumers and professionals who want the flexibility of a zoom lens, the ability to hone in on subjects without getting too close, or to capture unique video using DJI’s DollyZoom effect. The Mavic 2 Zoom can fly up to 45 mph (72.4 km/h) and stay in the air for up of 31 minutes. It offers up some of the same Intelligent Features as the Mavic 2 Pro, including the new Hyperlapse Quick Shot mode, and omnidirectional sensing for obstacle avoidance in all directions. It also includes 8GB on board memory. Extra Mavic 2 Intelligent Flight batteries, which are compatible with the Mavic 2 Pro, cost $159 each."
"DJI Mavic Air","The DJI Mavic Air is a foldable quadcopter that's small enough to slip into a handbag or jacket pocket. Weighing less than 16 ounces, it’s a very good ‘take anywhere’ drone. Despite its very small size, the Mavic Air has a complete feature set, and is a great choice for travel or to take on vacation. The Mavic Air boasts an impressive maximum speed of 68 km/h (42 mph). The 21-minute flight time is on the short side compared to many models. Its Advanced Pilot Assistance System (APAS) utilizes forward, backward, and downward vision sensors, as well as downward infrared sensors, to create a 3D map of the environment around the aircraft, allowing it to bypass or go around obstacles in its path. Given the amount of fun it is to operate, you’ll probably want to pick up some extra batteries at a cost of $79 each."
"Bomber Jackets","Also known as a flight jacket, a bomber jacket is a short, durable jacket with a zippered front and fitted or elastic waist and cuffs. The style originates from the US Air Force, where it was worn by flight crew members. Today, however, the bomber jacket is beloved by men of all professions. Perfect for a range of casual ensembles, this jacket is comfortable and highly versatile. While traditional bomber jackets are leather, the style now also commonly appears in nylon and other materials."
"Biker Jacket","For days when you’re feeling a little rebellious, there’s no better jacket than a biker jacket. Whether you’re a motorcyclist or not, this short, close-fitting, leather jacket with zips and studs appears stylish and tough. It also looks great with jeans and a T-shirt, making it a quick and easy option for times when you’re running late but still want to look good."
"Trucker Jacket","For those who don’t know, the trucker jacket is a type of button-front jacket that features double breast pockets. The style is typically short and fitted and often made of blue denim. However, other versions are also available, including suede styles, shearling-trimmed designs and options in different colours, such as brown and black. Overall, the trucker jacket is a timeless design that is perfect for the weekend."
"Denim Jackets","If you don’t already own at least one denim jacket, it’s time to invest. This versatile outerwear option looks excellent with countless casual and smart casual outfits. It’s also perfect for any time of the year. Wear one on summer nights with a white, crew-neck T-shirt and winter days over a black, turtleneck sweater and below a camel overcoat."
"Chef’s knife","A chef’s knife is one of the most versatile tools. Any professional chef will tell you this is a must-have. It should feel like an extension of your arm. It’s a go-to for chopping and dicing vegetables, fruit, and herbs. As well as cutting a variety of other ingredients like meat, poultry, and fish. They are usually 8 to 10 inches long, and the blade rounds at the tip. Don’t use it to peel small produce (it’s too large to be precise) and avoid using it to carve cooked meat."
"Santoku knife","With more of a straight blade, it has small indentations that make it easier for food to slide off. Like a chef’s knife, it’s also very versatile, great for chopping, dicing, and mincing ingredients, or slicing cheese. You can use it for just about anything you’d use a chef’s knife for; both are great all-purpose knives."
"Bread knife","Bread knives are long and have serrated edges. They easily carve through soft or crusty bread without sacrificing its integrity. When using, move it more like you would a saw than a chef’s knife. In addition to slicing bread, they can be used with other baked goods, too like cake. Other than bread, you can use them to cut large melons where straight blades often get stuck, slicing tomatoes, and breaking bars of chocolate into smaller bits."
"Utility knife","Utility knives are smaller than chef’s knives but not quite as petite as paring knives. They’re great for slicing and chopping small to midsize vegetables and cuts of meat. A serrated utility knife comes in handy for slicing sandwiches as well. A straight-blade utility knife is helpful when peeling produce, though sometimes that’s better left to paring knives."
